# Creating a Django virtual environment
1. Create a dedicated directory for virtual environment in terminal or powershell
`mkdir project_name `
2. Go to the created folder
`cd project_name`
3. Activate the virtual environment (make sure to install python package bundler `pipenv`)
`pipenv shell`
4. Make sure to install Django only after activating the virtual environment
`pipenv install django==3.0.3`
